				<h2>Maria Moroz</h2>
				<h3>Assistant Director, Lia Maria International Daycare</h3>
				<p>I have more than 32 years of experience in Elementary Education and hold a Masters Degree in Elementary Education. I am fluent in reading, writing and speaking Italian, Romanian, Russian and polishing my English skills. Born in the Republic of Moldova and immigrated to the USA in 2010. As a Mother of 3 grown children, 2 boys and Lilia, and Grandmother of 2 beautiful girls, I look forward to the opportunity to care for, play with, encourage, and perhaps teach your children Italian, Romanian or Russian.</p>

				<h2>Lilia Alzner</h2>
				<h3>Owner and Director, Lia Maria International Daycare</h3>
				<p>I was born and grew up in the Republic of Moldova in 1985. In June 2012 I received my Illinois state daycare license, as well as training and certification in adult/child/license in June 2012 and I am also certified in First Aid and CPR. I am fluent in English, Romania and Russian. I love to sing, dance, and have fun with my family. My goal hope is to teach your children at least one more language as they grow up and to introduce them to different cultures. Meeting the needs of the parent and the child is the backbone of a good daycare, and I believe my daycare will offer those needs. I would like to combine my mother’s (Maria Moroz) work experience and education to provide a professional way of operating my daycare service as well as encouraging early childhood development by exposing them to a second language through song, dance and play for the children in my care and give them the discipline they need for growth in the early years.</p>
				<p>I love my chosen profession, and there is no greater feeling then knowing that I have helped in the learning and growth of your child. What I enjoy most is seeing the expression of a child who has just discovered something new and wonderful, and when they are able to perform a new skill without assistance for the first time.</p>

				<h2>Family</h2>
				<p>My name is Lilia Alzner. When I was 19 I immigrated to the USA and married Bruce in 2005. He loves building things, working in the yard as well as fishing and hunting. We have 2 young girls, Amilia and Jessica who are 4 and 3 years. Amilia starting taking tap and ballet dace classes at the at Above the Barre Dance Academy when she was 22 months. Now, Amilia and Jessica, are going to Quad City Gymnastics Academy because they love gynamstics.</p>
				<p>We lived in Virginia for 2 years and then we moved to Germany for 3 years. Now we are  happily settled in Coal Valley, Illinois, where my husband hopes to retire from the Army and have lived here since the summer of 2010. My mother Maria moved in with us in 2010 when the Army moved us here from Germany. Maria had been working in Italy as a in-home adult care-giver for 5 years.</p>

				<h2>Indoor Play Area</h2>
				<p>At Lia Maria Daycare children take extreme pride in the various activities and materials used during indoor play. Their interests and imaginations are enhanced as each child engages in the many learning play stations throughout the play areas. Infants and toddlers improve motor skills as they roll the big ball back and forth on a play mat. All play materials and activities are age appropriate and cleaned regularly. The play area is well organized with many bins of toys, books, puzzles and activities that the children are quite familiar with. They are encouraged to play with any appropriate items, but also taught to share toys with other children and return toys to their proper places when they are done with them.</p>
				<p>Your child's safety and health is our main concern. We do not use physical or mental discipline of any kind with the children. We focus on use of positive praise, re-directing, time-outs, separation (based on child's age) and discussion as tools for guidance and discipline.</p>

				<h2>Outdoor Play Area</h2>
				<p>We like to spend time outdoors as often as weather permits each day that the children are here. We are happy to offer a newly constructed fenced in play area for children of all ages. The use of safe and age appropriate play equipments allows the children to get the necessary physical exercise needed for growth and youth development. The entire play area is on top of on four inches of rubber Kinder Mulch that provided a soft and safe surface for the occasional misstep on the climbing toys.</p>

				<h2>Dining Area</h2>
				<p>Family style dining is what we prefer and is an important part of our day. Not only do we learn many life skills, but family style dining also embraces the cozy home like atmosphere that we strive to offer here everyday. All food is placed in child size serving bowls or plates on the table and the children are encouraged to serve themselves or serve themselves with help from an adult. We sit at the table with the children, and we enjoy meaningful conversations together in a pleasant mealtime atmosphere, much like the children do at home with their families.</p>
				<p>We provide meals and snacks that include a variety of food groups including meat and meat alternates, bread and grains, fruits, vegetables and milk. Our menus rotate on a four-week schedule to provide variety for your child. Your children are given homemade meals made with fresh, wholesome ingredients.</p>

				<h2>Quiet Area</h2>
				<p>We have designated areas used for naptime. Based on the schedule children will be going to nap at or around 1:00 pm. Each child will be put in pack-n-play cribs, cots or full bed based on their age. The sheets will be washed once a week or as needed.  If your child has a toy or a blanket they like to sleep with you are welcome to bring it. We will be playing relaxing or classical music for the children during the nap time.</p>

				<h2>Quality</h2>
				<p>Forming positive relationships between the caregiver, parent, and child is essential to providing quality care. The parent is free to visit the child care program at all times and will be notified and made aware of any problems that may arise. Feel free to discuss any concerns with us so that we can provide your child exactly what he or she needs. Open lines of communication and knowing what occurs in your child’s day to day activities will give you a sense comfort. Our daycare is a mixed age licensed daycare home. We care for newborns through school age children and offer full and part time services. The daycare is open from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday, and we are closed on holidays. At our daycare there are always two adults who will supervise the children. </p>
